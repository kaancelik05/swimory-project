# Swimory UI Tokens

This package will host the shared design system tokens used by both web and mobile clients. The initial export captures the primary colors, typography, spacing, and radius values defined in the Swimory design system.

Future iterations will extend this package with reusable components, theming utilities, and platform-specific adapters.
